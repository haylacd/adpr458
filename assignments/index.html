<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a senior studying Advertising and Public Relations and Graphic Design. Being 
        a double major has helped me a lot in understanding the human side of design<br> and 
        the actual goal of design, which is probably where my interest in product 
        design came from. 
    </p>
<h2>Classes this Semester</h2>
    <p>This semester I'm the Lead Designer at Jacht and am currently taking classes I thought
        would be interesting for my final semester.<br> This includes ADPR458: Interactive Media Design,
        GRPH325: Interaction Design and my graphic design capstone class!
    </p>
 <h2>Outside of Class</h2>
    <p>I enjoy traveling, video games, movies and attempting to pet stray cats.</p>
<h2>After Graduation</h2>
    <p>After graduation I'll be working at the tech start-up, Kana Systems, and hopefully 
        design<br> some pretty cool products. Keep your eye out for what Kana is bringing to the table! </p>
